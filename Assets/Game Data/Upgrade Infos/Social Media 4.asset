  description: "When it comes to high quality social media, it\u2019s not only important
    to have perfectly edited posts, good advertisement and target audience. If you
    want to aim high and have your posts reach all around the world and gain traction
    among millions of people, you need to start working together with other companies
    that have the same focus as yours. You\u2019re happy with Marys\u2019 work, but
    she\u2019s still just a human and that\u2019s why you decided to hire 15 more
    social media workers that can spread our message across all the social media
    to the entire world."
