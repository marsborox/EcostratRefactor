  description: "You know how to create a post on social media, but you have no clue
    how to gain more reach. You spoke to your colleague Jane Rogers, who takes care
    of the social media of the company you work in. She\u2019s not the best, but
    at least she knows how to use hashtags and her posts have bigger reach.\r\n"
