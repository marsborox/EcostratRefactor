  description: "Romero actually did his job well, but most of the money he kept for
    himself. If you want to bribe and control higher management, you will need someone
    more courageous and trustworthy. Your friend Johny gave you a tip about his cousin
    Jake Reins, who works with a bunch of other companies and has control over some
    of their managers. He\u2019ll definitely be useful to you."
