  description: "If you want to have a paid advertisement, you also need to find someone
    who can successfully activate it. Unfortunately, Jane doesn\u2019t have enough
    experience and you have had to find someone better. Sam Tramor is in the 2nd
    grade at Stanford University, but he swore to be able to help you. You\u2019re
    just required to pay him his rent for 3 months. Let\u2019s hope he\u2019ll be
