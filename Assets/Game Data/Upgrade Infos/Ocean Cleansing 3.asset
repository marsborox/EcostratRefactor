  description: "Divers work great if it\u2019s in the shallow areas, however if we
    really plan to help our planet, we have to start doing it where the human eye
    can\u2019t see it. The oceans are polluted and we need to stop it. That\u2019s
    why you decide to buy two submarines that can help with the difficult conditions
    on the bottom of the oceans."
