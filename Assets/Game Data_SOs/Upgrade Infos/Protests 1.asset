  description: "Our skills with social networks and the number of our subscribers
    are primarily related to organising protests. But that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t
    improve. Learning how to write petitions is not particularly difficult, but in
    order to not miss a thing, we called in the help of a lawyer to help us with
    it."
