  description: "With great power there must also come great responsibility. And with
    great responsibility comes great caution. Relying on one person will no longer
    be possible if we want to remain completely anonymous. The team of 3 college
    friends, whose conversation you overheard in a cafe near your apartment, sounded
    quite engaged in topics that won\u2019t let you sleep well at night either. Dirt
    everywhere you look, garbage on every corner and not only on land. Cities that
    don\u2019t do anything about it and competent people pretend to be blind and
    deaf, only for the benefit of their own. You couldn\u2019t resist contacting
    one of the college group and introduced them with your own ideas. You finally
    came to the conclusion that they would be willing to lay their necks down for
    a good cause."
