  description: "Town officials and company managers are under your control, but if
    you want to aim higher, you also need to gain control over the bigger corporations
    and conglomerates. In this case you need to be completely discreet, the risk
    is high and one person just won\u2019t be enough. That\u2019s why you found a
    secret organised group which has a lot of experience with bribing. They present
    themselves under the name ProBribers, which definitely suggests they are highly
    professional."
