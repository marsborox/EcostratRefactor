  description: "Our protests are protected by one common idea. Take responsibility
    into your own hands and make order in high political and managerial corporations,
    for people who are not competent to meet our demands. The pressure we exert on
    them is unrelenting and we plan to continue with it. The more followers we gain,
    the bigger the protests become. But we will also need a much bigger team, to
    prepare all the locations and details of a legal protest. That\u2019s why you
    decided to contact a professional in this industry, John LaCante, who has a rich
    history in nationwide protests against presidents, terrorists and conglomerates.
    He\u2019s not cheap, but he offered us a full-time work with his entire team."
