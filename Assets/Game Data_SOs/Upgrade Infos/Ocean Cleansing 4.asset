  description: "You have already managed to do so much, but you can always do a little
    more. Cleansing actions serve the purpose, but are very demanding and can only
    be used once in a while. Based on the fact, that cleaning all the world\u2019s
    water surfaces even a day could mean saving our planet, you decide to develop
    a special robot SPU-P1, which stands for Special Cleaning Unit - Prototype 1.
    This makes our team focus on other areas than directly cleaning."
