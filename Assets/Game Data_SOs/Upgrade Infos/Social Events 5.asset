  description: "Instead of the usual garbage collection from parks or riverbeds,
    you\u2019ve decided to take it to another level. Our social events will be accompanied
    by a programme and speakers from the industry who are also trying to save our
    planet. We will teach people how to live ecologically, from small children to
    our grandparents. At the same time, we want everything from our events to be
    free for everyone."
