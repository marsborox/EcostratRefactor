  description: "The gang you work with is successful, but you\u2019re starting to
    get a bad feeling about their methods, which you\u2019d rather not go into too
    much detail for your peaceful sleep. However, if you want to increase your possibilities
    to the highest level, you need to find someone who will not only be successful,
    but also reliable and up-to-date. La Familia, a mafia organisation originally
    from Spain, has its roots firmly rooted in the political scene not only in the
    US, but in most of the world."
