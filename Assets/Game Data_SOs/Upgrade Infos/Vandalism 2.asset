  description: "Although the stickers spread your message, state corporations organise
    events to tear and collect these stickers. So you have to come up with something
    bigger. And your idea is.. Graffiti! Buying sprays and getting reliable sprayers
    won\u2019t be a cheap shopping spree, but that wouldn\u2019t be you if you didn\u2019t
    try to fix and save the planet."
