  description: "You are tired of the constant effort to spread the message for those
    who are deaf and blind to your legacy. Instead of begging others, let\u2019s
    show those who don\u2019t care that you and your followers will be heard, no
    matter what. However, organising an illegal protest costs a lot of effort and
    especially, the organisers can\u2019t be associated with it. You found a secret
    group on the dark web to help you with something like this, and you can only
    hope your followers will support you with their presence."
