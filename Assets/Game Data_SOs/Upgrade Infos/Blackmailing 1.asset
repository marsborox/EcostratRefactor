  description: "You never thought you would go this far. But planet Earth really
    needs you to save it. Unfortunately, sometimes a polite and politically correct
    letter written to the city office does not help. That\u2019s why you bought 7
    books on persuasion techniques and threat tactics, for less pleasant situations,
    for less friendly people. It\u2019s no glory, but it\u2019s important to understand
    this persuasive method first."
