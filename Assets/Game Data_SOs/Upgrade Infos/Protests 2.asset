  description: "Although we have protests in written form as well, speaking about
    bearing responsibility for the polluted environment, but also for taking bribes
    so that important people look the other way when such atrocities are committed
    on our planet. You\u2019ve put together a team of activists who will be happy
    to share our protests on their social networks and let their audience know that
    they\u2019re welcome to help us."
