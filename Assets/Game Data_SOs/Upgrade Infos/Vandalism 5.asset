  description: "We\u2019re already everywhere. The riots are written about on the
    internet, in the news and in the newspaper. Change is coming. It\u2019s risky,
    but you\u2019ll do anything to save the planet. You need cover from mafia organisation
    La Familia, because you\u2019ve been on the edge of the law for quite some time.
    The last step is to combine all our steps together by maximising the potential
    of vandalism and others. New stickers, more graffiti, more uprisings and hell
    in the streets of the capitals! We will not take our planet for granted and we
    will not back down until there\u2019s a change!"
