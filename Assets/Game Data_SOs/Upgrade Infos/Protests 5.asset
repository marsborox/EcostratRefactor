  description: "We need more familiar faces to speak for the population in their
    given region. If we want to create a global movement, we can\u2019t just focus
    on American companies and politicians. We need to expand worldwide. That\u2019s
    why you get in contact with similar organisations like us all over the world.
    With our knowledge, money and their people, we will be able to respond through
    protests all around the world.\r\n"
