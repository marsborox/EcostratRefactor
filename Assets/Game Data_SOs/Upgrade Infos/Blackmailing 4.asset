  description: "Sometimes it\u2019s really sad where a person has to go to be able
    to make a change. If we want to influence the decisions of the members of the
    National Council, it is necessary to be tougher. Mafia may be a strong word,
    but the Suburban Boston Gang is ready to help you after you encounter them in
    a bar on a street corner. $20,000 for using their own services and methods. The
    main thing is that the work will be taken care of."
