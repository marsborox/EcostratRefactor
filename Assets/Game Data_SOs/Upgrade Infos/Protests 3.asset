  description: Activists are great, especially those who cooperate with us. However,
    the main idea was not only to hang some kind of graphic on the social media with
    an invitation to the protest, but to be part of the protest. You found a much
    more solid and organised group of young activists who had already made their
    own protests in the past, with very similar context to ours. You decided to support
    their own initiative and invite them to participate in our own protests.
