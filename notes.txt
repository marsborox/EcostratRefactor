Somewhat fixed main menu (buttons not displayed, background is disabled tho)
Added Text explaining "Press Esc to skip intro"
Renamed Camera Canvas to UI Canvas (makes more sense)


when paused on action decide time keeps running- timescale?

GameManager - Update must be divided

time should be redone to timescale, buttons redone must be (x1, x2, x3)

mabye UI class and rest will inherit from it
