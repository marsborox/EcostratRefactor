Somewhat fixed main menu (buttons not displayed, background is disabled tho)
Added Text explaining "Press Esc to skip intro"
Renamed Camera Canvas to UI Canvas (makes more sense)
Fixed timer on ui (was running even when game paused)
Trash increment amount - was being increased same rate disregard the game speed - fixed



GameManager - Update must be divided - noto nly update
	-Update
	-Separate UI
	-Separate Sound
	-Separate Spawner
	-Separate Timer/TimeControl - DONE, moved all time relateed variables to TimeController
-Update-	 News relocated into news class, Update and ChangeStats must be separated into methods doing only one resource/playerStat
		enum PlayerStat - rework this, probably instances of PlayerStat inheriting classes playerGameObject?
		illegality and followerIncome is the same
		we can use one method for all slider display - can go to UI

create Singleton Classes - 2 presistent and only scene
	
top buttons - 	 made into toggle group, made own class for SpeedButtons,
		 assigned per interface w implemented InitiateButton method

	



buttons need fixing all of them


we have Interface for button initiation - does not have to be motherClass
its our standard InitiateButton, with playSound bonus

mabye UI class and rest will inherit from it
